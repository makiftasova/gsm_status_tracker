# GSM Status Tracker
An App to track and log SIM card status on Android phones

## Introduction
This app aims to track status of SIM acrd on Android phones.

It simply queries SIM status and logs them to `Documents/GSMListener/GSMListenerLog.txt`

This is a hastily written app to "debug" some real world problems observed by myself. Hence your milage may vary depending on your use case(s).
